**NOTE:** Denoify itself is a node module, it won't run on Deno.

# What it is

A build tool that takes as input a TypeScript codebase that was meant to target node and/or the web and spits out a modified version of the source files ready to be deployed as a Deno module.  

![what_denoify_does](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/85449626-41b10c80-b598-11ea-91cc-6805facab1dd.png)

If you are just looking for a quick way to load NPM modules in your Deno project
you can check out [CommonJS module Loading](https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/master/std/node/#commonjs-module-loading),
unlike Denoify, it won't give you types definitions, it will involve `node_modules/`
and require `--allow-read` but it will also be easier to get working.

This tool is mainly for NPM module maintainer, to enable them to bring first-class citizen Deno support to their modules and doing so without introducing breaking changes.

# Motivations

- Although it is quite easy to port a module to Deno no one wants to maintain two codebase.
- Wouldn't it be great to have a tool able to bring Deno support to NPM modules?

# Example of modules using Denoify

Modules that have been made cross-runtime using Denoify:

- [EVT](https://evt.land)
- [run-exclusive](https://github.com/garronej/run-exclusive)
- [Nano JSX](https://github.com/nanojsx/nano)

# Limitations

Coming up next is a detailed guide on how to set up denoify with your project and how
to publish on [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x) but before anything
here are the current limitations you need to be aware of.

- If your module is vanilla JS it needs to be ported to TypeScript first. (1)
- Not all Node's builtin are supported yet. (2)
- You will need to fork and denoify(3) manually each of your module's (not dev) dependencies. 
- For the dependencies that can't easily be denoified you will need to write a
  partial Deno port of the bits your module needs.
- `require()` is not yet supported.
- You can't (yet) `fs.readFile()` files that are part of the module ( files inside a ``res/`` 
  directory for example ). (4)

(1) *Don't be afraid, renaming your source with ``.ts`` and dropping some ``any`` here 
and there will do the trick.
You will be able to pull it off even if you aren't familiar with typescript. [Ref](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module#enable-strict-mode-and-fixes-errors-if-any)*

(2) *You can consult [here](https://deno.land/std/node#supported-builtins) the current state of the Node's builtin support.*

(3) *Glossary: To 'denoify' a module is the process of using this tool to generate a deno 
distribution of a module and to publish it on GitHub. 
How to do that is documented in details.*  

(4) *In Deno the files that forms your module wonâ€™t be pre-fetched and 
placed in ``node_module`` like in node so you wonâ€™t be able to access files that are not 
on the disk.*

# GUIDES

## Setting up an existing project

Check out [this repo](https://github.com/garronej/my_dummy_npm_and_deno_module) to see in practice how to set up Denoify in your project.

## Starting a project from scratch

![denoify_ci](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/82036935-c52a3480-96a1-11ea-9794-e982a23e5612.png)

[denoify_ci](https://github.com/garronej/denoify_ci) is a template repo that automates the boring and tedious tasks of:
- Filling up the ``package.json``
- Setting up TypeScript and [Denoify](https://github.com/garronej/denoify).
- Writing a [README.md](https://github.com/garronej/denoify_ci/blob/dev/README.template.md) with decent presentation and instructions on how to install/import your module in different environments.
- Testing with multiple ``Node`` and ``Deno`` versions before publishing.
- Publishing on NPM and [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x) ( via GitHub releases ).  

[Get started](https://github.com/garronej/denoify_ci)

**NEW v0.4.0**: Now that [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x) allows to publish modules under a subdirectory of a GitHub repo
denoify no longer generate a `mod.ts` at the root of the project but under `deno_dist`. `deno_dist` should be stipulated 
as subdirectory when registering your module on [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x).

# TODO LIST / Things that need to change

- [x] Support `myModule.deno.ts` alongside `myModule.ts` for deno specific implementation of part of the code. (Like in React Native)
- [x] Support custom replacer for `import/export` statements.
- [x] ðŸ”¥ Support CDN ([Pika](https://www.pika.dev/cdn), [jspm](https://jspm.org), [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) ...) urls as Deno ports and feature [side loading of type definitions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/85604253-6ae1a380-b651-11ea-9406-38bb57f190de.png). Done via custom replacer.
- [x] Support `.tsx`
- [ ] `index.ts` should be rename `mod.ts` to respect Deno's naming recommendations.
- [ ] Add cli option for specifying the output directory.
